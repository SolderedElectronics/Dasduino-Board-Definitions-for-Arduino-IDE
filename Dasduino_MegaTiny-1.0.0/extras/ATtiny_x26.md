The 20-pin 2-series parts bring one very exciting feature, particularly for those who like using serial bootloaders instead of UPDI - the Reset function can be moved to pin PB4, allowing PA0 to remain UPDI, while also having a proper hardware reset! These are being advertised in SOIC-20 and the super tiny 3mm x 3mm QFN of the 1-series, plus SSOP. Not sure SSOP will set the world on fire. It's also not certain yet if they will actually make the 32k parts available in the QFN - fingers crossed.

DAC, TCD, and the extra analog comparators have been removed in favor of a second UART, and the super ADC, which can accumulate 1024 samples in a single burst read; decimation of the accumulated value so all of the digits are meaningful can give up to 17-bits of accuracy. For advanced ADC functionality, several new functions are provided, see ADC section of the main readme for more information.

Optiboot will be available in a future release, there are minor adjustments needed, and I think the board configuration options there are different enough from 0/1-series, particularly for the 20 and 24-pin parts, that they are better served by their own top level board menu option.
