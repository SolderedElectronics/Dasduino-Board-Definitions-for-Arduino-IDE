   * you need inputs? Assuming VDD > VDDIO2, any GPIO pin could be connected to that source
   * but normally you can't read them reliably. The schmitt trigger is only guaranteed to read
   * HIGH above 0.8*Vcc, so even 3.3v logic (which is widely known to be pretty reliable)
   * isn't in spec for a part running Vdd = 5.0 V!
   *
   * The solution is to set INLVL to TTL mode, which guarantees a LOW when Vin < 0.8 V and
   * a HIGH when Vin > 1.6 V.
   *
   * Whenever you're interacting with something that might use lower logic level, enable this.
   * Set or clear only - toggle not supported. I question the usefulness of the other PINnCTRL
   * toggles, but here I have very little doubt: If you want a toggle INLVL option, you're in an
   * X-Y problem and are going about something sufficiently wrong  that it is more helpful to not
   * give you that tool than help you go further into the weeds. */
