# tinyAVR 0/1/2-series Errata Summary

Microcontrollers, like any other product, often have bugs which are discovered only after the product is released. Sometimes these are fixed in later "silicon revisions" - other times they are not. Frequently, silicon revisions for a given part may be released with no apparent changes to any of the issues with the part in question. These defects are documented in the "Silicon Errata" provided by the manufacturer. On the classic AVR parts, this was often a chapter near the end of the datasheet - and was generally quite short (off the top of my head, the only classic AVR that I can think of where it's frequently an issue is the ATtiny1634, where one pin can't be used as an input if the WDT is not running).

Well, for the tinyAVR 0/1-series, the list of issues is a tiny bit longer. By which I mean, the index of errata is longer than the entire errata section of most classic AVRs - likely because these were some of the first parts released with many of the new peripherals (though the megaAVR 0-series had come out slightly earlier, the 1-series had many peripherals not featured in the megaAVR 0-series, and where a peripheral was on both series, it is broken the same way over there too).

The lists of errata are ~hidden~ located in a separate docukent, the "Errata and datasheet clarification" sheet for the part now, instead of being in the datasheet proper like it was on classic AVRs. You know, just to make it easier for the users, so we don't have to skip over a few pages of highly relevant information on errata if we have one of the non-existent versions that doesn't have all these problems. Nope, they're _totally_ not trying to hush up the bugs until you've made the buying decision and gotten too deep in the design process to switch MCUs to a competitors' one or anything, nosiree - it's just to make things easier you you, the users! The specific errata relevant to a given part vary depending on the specific part and and silicon revision. The silicon revision can be read from the `SYSCFG.REVID` register (0 = A, 1 = B, etc). It is also marked on the chip - though my understanding is that us mere mortals are not trusted with the secret of how to do so, and must have Microchip folks help with that.

Note that Rev. C of the 32k parts has been released and fixes a substantial amount of errata. It fixes some of the RTC stuff, it fixes the
D-latch and the fact that you had to enable pin output to use the link output source on a downstream LUT as well as assorted other issues. Hopefully we will see these changes brought to other parts in the tinyAVR 0/1-series in the future.

```c
Serial.print("Silicon revision is: ");
Serial.println(SYSCFG.REVID);
```

Thankfully, most of these issues will not be encountered by most Arduino users. The impact column indicates the liklihood that someone working with an effected part through megaTinyCore and Arduino would encounter it.
* 0 - Impact unlikely and non-serious if it does occur.
* 1 - Impact unlikely to cause issue or degrade functionality under ordinary conditions. Things that can only manifest under extreme corner cases are usaually in this category. There are usually a number of approaches to working around these, as well,
* 2 - Impact likely when using features that are not particularly exotic, but has viable workaround and is not visible through the API provided by the core. This includes cases where the feature is inoperable but the workaround is truly trivial.
* 3 - Issue impacted functions provided by megaTinyCore or included libraries in previous versions, but worked around in current version, and will impact users of this functionality if reconfigured manually, or unavoidably impacts functionality exposed by core or included libraries, but can be worked around with little overall mipact..
* 4 - Issue has a large impact on the relevant functionality in configurations other than the most common ones, without requiring an exotic corner case to trigger. In cases where the impacted features are exposed by the core or included libraries, it may not be possible to hide the issue.
* 5 - Issue has a large impact on the relevant functionality in all or the most common configurations. If that is provided by the core or library, we may be unable to hide the issue. If it involves manual configuration, that functionality will be completely and totally unusable without workarounds, and those may not hide it entirely.
* `*` - Issue is high impact but effected devices are rare
* ? - Issue appears consistent with the datasheet....


## tinyAVR 2-series
Unlike the other devices this core supports, the list of errata for the 2-series a real treat, wouldn't you say?

Erratum                                                               | Impact | 4/8k rev. B | 16k rev. E | Notes

Open-Drain Mode Does Not Work When TXD is Configured as Output        |    2   |      X      |      X     | Universally present on modern AVRs.

Note that a very different errata sheet for a Rev. D of the 16k parts was distributed, with a number of issues impacting the new ADC. However, after that was published, the relevant decision makers came to their senses (whether due to customer backlash, the discovery of a more troubling issue that they never publicly disclosed in Rev. D, or saner heads prevailing in general is left to our imagination). The Rev. D "was not released to production", and those issues are all gone from the released Rev. E.

## tinyAVR 0/1/2-series Errata Details

These errata details are taken verbatim from the Silicon Errata and Datasheet Clarification documents except as noted below - see the links in the [datasheet pages](Datasheets.md) - they have only been formatted for markdown, and gathered from the multiple errata sheets into a single document for ease of comparison and reference. Be sure to check that a given item applies to the part you are working with on the above tables.

For each issue, we have added a **megaTinyCore note** describing impact on megaTinyCore users. In a very small number of cases, we have marked annotated the text for clarity in the context of this combined errata document, these notes are *in italics* and the old wording in ~strikethrough~.


### Device
#### IDD Power-Down Current Consumption (16k 2-series, Rev. E only)
The IDD power-down leakage can exceed the targeted maximum value of 2 µA. Note that this maximum value is a target and not documented in the preliminary data sheet.

**Workaround:** None.

#### On ~24-Pin~ *ATtiny1617* Automotive Devices Pin PC5 is Not Available
On ~24-pin~ *ATtiny1617* automotive devices pin PC5 is not available.

**Workaround:** Do not connect pin PC5 and disable input on pin (PORTC.PINTCRL5.ISC=0x4)

**megaTinyCore note:** The effected part is unlikely to be used with megaTinyCore

#### Writing the OSCLOCK Fuse in `FUSE.OSCCFG` to '1' Prevents Automatic Loading of Calibration
Writing the OSCLOCK fuse in `FUSE.OSCCFG` to '1' prevents the automatic loading of calibration values from the signature row. The device will run with an uncalibrated OSC20M oscillator.

**Workaround:** Do not use OSCLOCK for locking the oscillator calibration value. The oscillator calibration value can be locked by writing LOCK in `CLKCTRL.OSC`20MCALIBB to '1'.

**megaTinyCore note:** No concern. We do not set that fuse.

#### The Temperature Sensor is Not Calibrated on Parts with Date Code 727, 728 and 1728 (Year 2017, Week 27/28)
The temperature sensor is not calibrated on parts with date code 727/728 (used on QFN packages) and 1728 (used on SOIC packages).
**Workaround:** If temperature sensor calibration data is required, devices with the affected date code may be returned through the Microchip RMA service. Devices with this date code are no longer shipped by Microchip.

**megaTinyCore note:** These are unlikely to be found in the wild anymore.

### AC - Analog Comparator
#### Coupling Through AC Pins
There is a capacitive coupling through the Analog Comparator. Toggling the selected positive AC pin may affect the selected negative input pin and vice versa.

**Workaround:** When the AC is disabled, configure AC.MUXCTRLA.MUXNEG to DAC or internal reference.

**megaTinyCore note:** It is not clear when this is relevant or how large the effect is, but it isn't present on very many parts.

#### AC Interrupt Flag Not Set Unless Interrupt is Enabled
`ACn.STATUS.CMP` is not set if the `ACn.INTCTRL.CMP` is not set.

**Workaround:** Enable `ACn.INTCTRL.CMP` or use `ACn.STATUS.STATE` for polling.

**megaTinyCore note:** The included Comparator library does not poll the interrupt flag.

#### False Triggers May Occur Under Certain Conditions
False triggers may occur on falling input pin:
* If the slew rate on the input signal is greater than 2 V/µs for common-mode voltage below 0.5V
* If the slew rate on the input signal is greater than 10 V/µs for common-mode voltage above 0.5V
* If the slew rate on the input signal is greater than 10 V/µs for any common-mode voltage and Low-Power mode
is enabled

**Workaround:** None.

#### False Triggering When Sweeping Negative Input of the AC When the Low-Power Mode is Disabled
A false trigger may occur if sweeping the negative input of the AC with a negative slope, and the AC has Low-Power mode disabled.

**Workaround:** Enable Low-Power mode in `AC.CTRLA.LPMODE`.

**megaTinyCore note:** These two issues are potentially relevant now that we have a comparator library. Note that they do not impact all parts.

### ADC - Analog-to-Digital Converter
#### SAMPDLY and ASDV Does Not Work Together With SAMPLEN
Using `SAMPCTRL.SAMPLEN` at the same time as `CTRLD.SAMPDLY` or `CTRLD.ASDV` will cause an unpredictable sampling length.

**Workaround:** When setting `SAMPCTRL.SAMPLEN` greater than 0x0, the `CTRLD.SAMPDLY` and `CTRLD.ASDV` must be cleared.

**megaTinyCore note:** Not an issue unless you reconfigure the ADC manually, but be aware that megaTinyCore does set SAMPLEN by default.

#### Pending Event Stuck When Disabling the ADC
If the ADC is disabled during an event-triggered conversion, the event will not be cleared.

**Workaround:** Clear `ADC.EVCTRL.STARTEI` and wait for the conversion to complete before disabling the ADC.

**megaTinyCore note:** Only an issue if you reconfigure the ADC to use the event system as a start trigger, and then disable the ADC. Use suggested workaround in this case.

#### ADC Functionality Cannot be Ensured with CLKADC Above 1.5 MHz and a Setting of 25% Duty Cycle
The ADC functionality cannot be ensured if CLKADC > 1.5 MHz with `ADCn.CALIB.DUTYCYC` set to '1'.

**Workaround:** If ADC is operated with CLKADC > 1.5 MHz, `ADCn.CALIB.DUTYCYC` must be set to '0' (50% duty cycle).

**megaTinyCore note:** megaTinyCore sets CLKADC at 1.0 - 1.25 MHz. It is unclear to me where they ever said > 1.5 MHz was okay for the ADC clock!

#### ADC Performance Degrades with CLKADC Above 1.5 MHz and VDD < 2.7V
The ADC INL performance degrades if CLKADC > 1.5 MHz and `ADCn.CALIB.DUTYCYC` set to '0' for VDD < 2.7V.

**Workaround:** None.

**megaTinyCore note:** megaTinyCore sets CLKADC at 1.0 - 1.25 MHz. It is unclear to me where they ever said > 1.5 MHz was okay for the ADC clock!

#### ADC Interrupt Flags Cleared When Reading RESH
`ADCn.INTFLAGS.RESRDY` and `ADCn.INTFLAGS.WCOMP` are cleared when reading `ADCn.RESH`.

**Workaround:** In 8-bit mode, read `ADCn.RESH` to clear the flag or clear the flag directly.

**megaTinyCore note:** megaTinyCore always reads the whole register, so this is not an issue unless you write your own routine for reading the ADC result in 8-bit mode.

#### Changing ADC Control Bits During Free-Running Mode not Working
If control signals are changed during Free-Running mode, the new configuration is not properly taken into account in the next measurement. This is valid for the `ADC.CTRLB`, `ADC.CTRLC`, `ADC.SAMPCTRL` registers and the `ADC.MUXPOS`, `ADC.WINLT` and `ADC.WINHT` registers.

**Workaround:** Disable ADC Free-Running mode before updating the `ADC.CTRLB`, `ADC.CTRLC`, `ADC.SAMPCTRL`,
`ADC.MUXPOS`, `ADC.WINLT` or `ADC.WINHT` registers.

**megaTinyCore note:** If you reconfigure the ADC for free running mode and were hoping to configure it while it was live, you must be aware of this.

#### One Extra Measurement Performed After Disabling ADC Free-Running Mode
The ADC may perform one additional measurement after clearing `ADCn.CTRLA.FREERUN`.

**Workaround:** Write `ADCn.CTRLA.ENABLE` to '0' to stop the Free-Running mode immediately.

**megaTinyCore note:** If you reconfigure the ADC for free running mode, you should be aware of this, the workaround is easy.

#### ADC Wake-Up with WCOMP
When waking up from STANDBY sleep mode with ADC WCOMP interrupt, the ADC is disabled for a few cycles
before the device enters ACTIVE mode. A new INITDLY is required before the next conversion.

**Workaround:** Use INITDLY before the next conversion.

**megaTinyCore note:** And how do you force it to wait for another INITDLY?

### PORTMUX - Port Multiplexer
#### Selecting Alternative Output Pin for TCA0 Waveform Output 0-2 also Changes Waveform Output 3-5
Selecting alternative output pin for TCA0 in PORTMUX.CTRLC does not work as described when TCA0 operates in split mode.
* Writing PORTMUX.CTRLC bit 0 to '1' will shift the pin position for both WO0 and WO3
* Writing PORTMUX.CTRLC bit 1 to '1' will shift the pin position for both WO1 and WO4
* Writing PORTMUX.CTRLC bit 2 to '1' will shift the pin position for both WO2 and WO5
PORTMUX.CTRLC[5:3] are non-functional.

**Workaround:** None.

**megaTinyCore note:** megaTinyCore only reconfigures the output pins by default on the 8-pin parts, none of those are impacted by this.

### CCL - Configurable Custom Logic
#### The CCL Must be Disabled to Change the Configuration of a Single LUT
To reconfigure a LUT, the CCL peripheral must be disabled (write ENABLE in CCL.CTRLA to ‘0’). Writing ENABLE to ‘0’ will disable all the LUTs, and affects the LUTs not under reconfiguration.

**Workaround:** None

**megaTinyCore note:** I had assumed this annoying behavior was intended. It is present in literally every part that has a CCL in all silicon revisions available as of July 2021

#### Connecting LUTs in Linked Mode Requires OUTEN Set to '1'
Connecting the LUTs in linked mode requires `LUTnCTRLA.OUTEN` set to '1' for the LUT providing the input source.

**Workaround:** Use an event channel to link the LUTs or do not use the corresponding I/O pin for other purposes.

**megaTinyCore note:** - I have rated the severity a 3 on 1-series and 5 on 0-series, because they only have 2 event channels total that can carry async signal.

#### D-latch is Not Functional
The CCL D-latch is not functional.

**Workaround:** None.

**megaTinyCore note:** This is broken on anything released before 2020. Don't try to use the D-latch sequential logic on 0/1-series parts. The D Flip-Flop can be used instead for many use cases, though it is clocked, which may make it less convenient than the latch. In any case, that's the less useful kind of latch anyway.

### RTC - Real-Time Counter
#### Any Write to the `RTC.CTRLA` Register Resets the RTC and PIT Prescaler
Any write to the `RTC.CTRLA` register resets the RTC and PIT prescaler.

**Workaround:** None.

**megaTinyCore note:** Neither RTC as millis source nor megaTinySleep are impacted. However, any use of the RTC other than those provided by the core has a high chance of encountering this. Additionally, the behavior that results is just wacky. We had a user who was just going nuts with this and the other RTC bug.

#### Disabling the RTC Stops the PIT
Writing `RTC.CTRLA.RTCEN` to '0' will stop the PIT.
Writing `RTC.PITCTRLA.PITEN` to '0' will stop the RTC.

**Workaround:** Do not disable the RTC or the PIT if any of the modules are used.

**megaTinyCore note:** Neither RTC as millis source nor megaTinySleep are impacted, HOWEVER **Any manual configuration of the RTC will be unsuccessful if this issue is not taken into account** This behaves far less simply than they describe, and it can be profoundly baffling and very nasty when using the RTC. This was reported by a user on ATtiny412; it stands to reason that on impacted parts, the other one doesn't "stop" - but rather "behaves in a manner inconsistent with documentation"
  1. Set RTC clock source but don't enable it.
  2. Enable the PIT with desired period.
  3. Notice that PIT is working, while RTC is not enabled.
  4. Attempt to reconfigure the RTC, doing the usual while(RTC.STATUS) to check that it's not busy syncing before changing RTC settings.
  5. Sketch will hang in that while loop forever because RTC.CNTBUSY will read 1 until the RTC is enabled.

### TCA - Timer/Counter A
#### Restart Will Reset Counter Direction in NORMAL and FRQ Mode
When the TCA is configured to a NORMAL or FRQ mode (WGMODE in TCAn.CTRLB is ‘0x0’ or ‘0x1’), a RESTART command or Restart event will reset the count direction to default. The default is counting upwards.

**Workaround:** None.

**megaTinyCore note:** Only impacts users who reconfigure TCA0 and use RESTART commands or events while the timer is counting down, a small crosssection of all users, and especially megaTinyCore users. Impacts every released part with a TCA as if July 2021. What I do not understand is why this is considered errata at all, as the datasheet for these parts says, of that command, *"The software can force a restart of the current waveform period by issuing a RESTART command. In this case, the counter, **direction**, and all compare outputs are set to '0'."*

### TCB - Timer/Counter B
#### CCMP and CNT Registers Operate as 16-Bit Registers in 8-Bit PWM Mode
When the TCB is operating in 8-bit PWM mode (CNTMODE in TCBn.CTRLB is ‘0x7’), the low and high bytes for the CNT and CCMP registers operate as 16-bit registers for read and write. They cannot be read or written independently.

**Work Around:** Use 16-bit register access. Refer to the data sheet for further information.

**megaTinyCore note:** Only impacts users who reconfigure a Type B timer to get PWM - which isn't terribly useful on these parts anyway, especially considering competing demands for TCBs. Impacts every released part with a TCB as if July 2021. I had run into this several times and been confused by it, but somehow never figured out what was going on until a few weeks before it was added to errata sheets.

#### Minimum Event Duration Must Exceed the Selected Clock Period
Event detection will fail if TCBn receives an input event with a high/low period shorter than the period of the selected clock source (CLKSEL in `TCBn.CTRLA`). This applies to the TCB modes (CNTMODE in `TCBn.CTRLB`) Time-Out Check and Input Capture Frequency and Pulse-Width Measurement mode.

**Workaround:** Ensure that the high/low period of input events is equal to or longer than the period of the selected clock source
(CLKSEL in `TCBn.CTRLA`).

**megaTinyCore note:** Only impacts users who reconfigure a Type B timer for input capture.

#### The TCB Interrupt Flag is Cleared When Reading CCMPH
`TCBn.INTFLAGS.CAPT` is cleared when reading `TCBn.CCMPH` instead of CCMPL.

**Workaround:** Read both `TCBn.CCMPL` and `TCBn.CCMPH`.

**megaTinyCore note:** Only impacts users who reconfigure a Type B timer for input capture, but only cares about the low byte, not the high byte, and doesn't immediately recognize that when running into the bug that the interrupt flag isn't getting cleared and clear it manually (which is the most obvious cause and something to check first whenever sketch activity nearly hangs as soon as an interrupt is triggered, especially if it's only "nearly" hung). In addition to the suggested workaround of reading both bytes, you can also just manually clear the interrupt flag. Under typical conditions, whether you readthe second byte or manually clear the flag will have the same run time - but manually clearing it will typically take 3 extra words of flash, while reading it will only take 1. `uint8_t val=TCBn.CCMP`will generate correct code.

#### TCB Input Capture Frequency and Pulse-Width Measurement Mode Not Working with Prescaled
Clock The TCB Input Capture Frequency and Pulse-Width Measurement mode may lock to Freeze state if CLKSEL in
`TCB.CTRLA` is set to any other value than 0x0.

**Workaround:** Only use CLKSEL equal to 0x0 when using Input Capture Frequency and Pulse-Width Measurement mode.

**megaTinyCore note:** Only impacts users who reconfigure a Type B timer for these input capture modes.

#### The TCA Restart Command Does Not Force a Restart of TCB
The TCA restart command does not force a restart of the TCB when TCB is running in SYNCUPD mode. TCB is only restarted after a TCA OVF.

**Workaround:** None.

**megaTinyCore note:** No impact unless you are trying to use this unusual feature.

### TCD - Timer/Counter D
#### TCD Event Output Lines May Give False Events
The TCD event output lines can give out false events.

**Workaround:** Use the delayed event functionality with a minimum of one cycle delay.

**megaTinyCore note:** Only an issue if using TCD0 as an event source, and fixed on some versions of these parts. Does anyone have any idea under WHAT conditions false outputs were generated?

#### TCD Auto-Update Not Working
The TCD auto-update feature is not working.

**Workaround:** None.

**megaTinyCore note:** This is accounted for in by the analogWrite() function on pins controlled by TCD0 after it was discovered the hard way.

#### Asynchronous Input Events Not Working When TCD Counter Prescaler is Used
When the TCD is configured to use asynchronous input events (CFG in TCDn.EVCTRLx is ‘0x2’) and the TCDCounter Prescaler (CNTPRES in TCDn.CTRLA) is different from ‘0x0’ events can be missed.

**Workaround:** Use the TCD Synchronization Prescaler (SYNCPRES in TCDn.CTRLA) instead of the TCD Counter Prescaler. Alternatively, use synchronous input events (CFG in TCDn.EVCTRLx is not ‘0x2’) if the input events are longer than one CLK_TCD_CNT cycle.

**megaTinyCore note:** This only matters if you're reconfiguring the type D timer in very deep ways. Impacts every available device with a TCD as of July 2021.

### TWI - Two-Wire Interface
#### TIMEOUT Bits in the `TWI.MCTRLB` Register are Not Accessible

The TIMEOUT bits in the `TWI.MCTRLB` register are not accessible from software.

**Workaround:** When initializing TWI, BUSSTATE in `TWI.MSTATUS` should be brought into IDLE state by writing 0x1 to it.

#### TWI Master Mode Wrongly Detects the Start Bit as a Stop Bit
If TWI is enabled in Master mode followed by an immediate write to the MADDR register, the bus monitor recognizes the Start bit as a Stop bit.

**Workaround:** Wait for a minimum of two clock cycles from `TWI.MCTRLA.ENABLE` until `TWI.MADDR` is written.

**megaTinyCore note:** No concern for megaTinyCore users unless you write your own I2C implementation and it's particularly fast; Wire.h does not run into this issue.

#### TWI Smart Mode Gives Extra Clock Pulse
TWI Master with Smart mode enabled gives an extra clock pulse on the SCL line after sending NACK.

**Workaround:** None.

**megaTinyCore note:** No concern for megaTinyCore users unless you write your own I2C implementation, Wire.h uses the TWI hardware in dumb mode.

#### The TWI Master Enable Quick Command is Not Accessible
`TWI.MCTRLA.QCEN` is not accessible from software.

**Workaround:** None.

**megaTinyCore note:** No concern for megaTinyCore users unless you write your own I2C implementation, our Wire implementation doesn't quick command either.

### USART - Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter
#### TXD Pin Override Not Released When Disabling the Transmitter
The USART will not release the TXD pin override if:
* The USART transmitter is disabled by writing the TXEN bit in `USART.CTRLB` to '0' while the USART receiver is
disabled (RXEN in `USART.CTRLB` is '0')
* Both the USART transmitter and receiver are disabled at the same time by writing the TXEN and RXEN bits in
`USART.CTRLB` to '0'

**Workaround:** There are two possible work arounds:

* Make sure the receiver is enabled (RXEN in `USART.CTRLB` is '1') while disabling the transmitter (writing TXEN
in `USART.CTRLB` to '0')
* Writing to any register in the USART after disabling the transmitter will start the USART for long enough to
release the pin override of the TXD pin

**megaTinyCore note:** Despite the issue being trivial to work around, and frequently implicitly hidden (by the second clause of the workaround above), this impacts versions of megaTinyCore prior to 2.0.6 when calling Serial.end() on effected devices.

#### Full Range Duty Cycle Not Supported When Validating LIN Sync Field
For the LIN sync field, the USART is validating each bit to be within ±15% instead of the time between falling edges as described in the LIN specification. This allows a minimum duty cycle of 43.5% and a maximum duty cycle of 57.5%.

**Workaround:** None.

**megaTinyCore note:** Only a concern if reconfiguring USART for LIN, and using the sync field for autobaud, relying upon the threshold being exactly what the standard required.

#### Frame Error on a Previous Message May Cause False Start Bit Detection
A false start bit detection will trigger if receiving a frame with `RXDATAH.FERR` set and reading the RXDATAL before the RxD line goes high.

**Workaround:** Wait for the RXD pin to go high before reading RXDATA, for instance, by polling the bit in `PORTn.IN` where the RXD
pin is located.
**megaTinyCore note:** This, technically, impacts our serial implementation on effected parts. However, if you are receiving framing errors, the baud rates or port settings are wrong on one or both side - so instead of receiving one byte of garbage, you'd receive two bytes of slightly different garbage. I do not believe there are cases where this can result in data that would have otherwise been inteligible coming out as garbage short of a transient framing error in a long string of continuous data, where it never has a change to regain it's bearings.

#### Open-Drain Mode Does Not Work When TXD is Configured as Output
When the USART TXD pin is configured as an output, it can drive the pin high regardless of whether the Open-Drain mode is enabled or not.

**Workaround:** Configure the TXD pin as an input by writing the corresponding bit in PORTx.DIR to '0' when using Open-Drain
mode.
**megaTinyCore note:** We don't provide a wrapper around this mode - yet - though it could be enabled manually, in which case it would be an issue on effected parts; the workaround is trivial - AS LONG AS YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. This bug was known very early on; They really ought to mention this in the actual datasheet instead of the errata!

#### Start-of-Frame Detection Can Unintentionally Be Enabled in Active Mode When RXCIF Is ‘0’
The Start-of-Frame Detector can unintentionally be enabled when the device is in Active mode and when the Receive Complete Interrupt Flag (RXCIF) in the USARTn.STATUS register is ‘0’. If the Receive Data (RXDATA) registers are read while receiving new data, RXCIF is cleared, and the Start-of-Frame Detector will be enabled and falsely detects the following falling edge as a start bit. When the Start-of-Frame Detector detects a start condition, the frame reception is restarted, resulting in corrupt received data. Note that the USART Receive Start Interrupt Flag (RXSIF) always is ‘0’ when in Active mode. No interrupt will be triggered.

**Workaround:** Disable Start-of-Frame Detection by writing ‘0’ to the Start-of-Frame Detection Enable (SFDEN) bit in the USART Control B (USARTn.CTRLB) register when the device is in Active mode. Re-enable it by writing the bit to ‘1’ before transitioning to Standby sleep mode. This work around depends on a protocol preventing a new incoming frame when re-enabling Start-of-Frame Detection. Re-enabling Start-of-Frame Detection, while a new frame is already incoming, will result in corrupted received data.

**megaTinyCore note:** If you're configuring the part to wake using start of frame detection, you need to be aware of this. Impacts every available modern AVR device as of July 2021. One really wonders how this went unnoticed until 2020.
