# Index of Important Information
Since people frequently miss it, it is hoped that this document will help steer people to key information relevant to the core.

## What to do if you find a bug
Check the [issue list](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore/issues) on Github, and if your problem isn't alreadty there, create an issue in Github. Otherwise, I am not aware that there is any problem, and hence have no plans to correct it.

### If you're not sure if it's a bug or misunderstanding
Post in the [discussions section](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore/discussions) and ask - I still get notifications, but i try to keep issues on the topic of actual defects with the core, since it's used as a to-do list.


## Supported Parts
These pages contain pinout charts, specs, and datasheet links. Just like the pinout charts for the official boards, these are required reading for even the simplest projects and demonstrations.

## From the Manufacturer
* [The datasheets are](Datasheets.md) the official, authoritative resource that describes the expected behavior of any part. As soon as you need to step outide the Arduino API, you'll need it.
* [The I/O headers are](ioheaders/README.md) where all those register names and constants specific to these parts are defined, like the capitalized ones ending in `_bm` (bit mask) `_bp` (bit position) `_gm` (group mask) `_gp` (group position) and `_gc` (group code). I recommend copy/pasting the names from those files, rather than trying to deduce how they named a given one, and attempting to type and spell it correctly.
* [AVR Instruction Set Manual](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/AVR-InstructionSet-Manual-DS40002198.pdf) The holy scripture of the AVR instruction set. Depending on the programmer and the task, it is either completely irrelevant, or absolutely essential. I keep a copy it open in my PDF viewer at all times.
* [Silicon Errata](Errata.md) are "bugs" in the hardware. These are covered in a document separate from the datasheet, so really, to understand how to do something, you read the datasheet, then go check the errata to see if anything you just read was actually wrong for the version of the parts that exists in reality, instead of what was intended. Unfortunately, the 0-series, and especially the 1-series, has a LOT of errata, much of which has not been fixed and may never be. Fortunately, matters are considerably better on the 2-series; particularly notable is the absence of issues related to the new ADC.

## Installation information
We only officially support (and test on) the Arduino IDE. Other IDEs are often used and are well thought of, but I do not have time to learn them; issues reported which only reproduce on alternative IDEs must include some information on what I'm supposed to do to fix it; I have no relevant knowledge of those platforms.
* [Arduino IDE](../../Installation.md) is the only platform tested internally.
* [PlatformIO](PlatformIO.md) is very popular. You can thank @MCUDude for most of the work to get this core supported over there, and that guide
* [Arduino-cli](Arduino-cli.md) is an official command-line version of Arduino. This guide was submitted by @dattasaurabh82 - THANKS!

## General information
* [Change Log](../../ChangeLog.md) weith listings of all changes that I remembered to record.
* [README](../../README.md) **(READ IT)** This is the main documentation which describes the state of the standard Arduino API functions and general caveats and key information about these parts, as well as special features of this core. There are sections of that file covering most significant areas of megaTinyCore, including sections on I2C, SPI, and reading analog voltages, including the advanced functionality of the ADC in the 2-series parts, and much more.
* [Making UPDI programmer](../../MakeUPDIProgrammer.md) These (unless running Optiboot) require a UPDI programmer, not a classic SPI programmer like a USBAsp/etc. Fortunately a dirt cheap serial adapter can be used as a UPDI programmer - or a cheap nano clone can be loaded with jtag2updi - either way gets you a UPDI programmer for the cost of a cup of coffee.
* [Direct Port Manipulation](DirectPortManipulation.md) Like with the classic AVR parts, you can use direct port manipulation for ultra-fast read and write from pin. The names of the registers are different, and there are some additional caveats, but also some improvements, and the pins and their interrupts are, overall, more powerful.
* [Sleep modes and power down](PowerSave.md) The same sorts of power savings available on classic AVRs are also available with the new tinyAVR parts - with slight differences in the setup procedures, but few substantial differences. Power-down sleep mode consumption of 0.1uA at 25C is typical assuming you can get all the peripherals turned off (at higher temperatures, power consumption is markedly higher - at 85C, the top of the range, 5uA in powerdown is typical). See the datasheet for more details.
* [Names of the interrupt vectors on all parts](InterruptVectorNames.md) because for reasons I do not understand, it's a warning, not an error, to make a typo in the name of a vector; the compiled result hangs if this improperly defined interrupt is triggered. **This also contains some general information on interrupts on these parts.**
* [Taking over TCA0](TakingOverTCA0.md) and using it to generate 16-bit PWM, or 16 bit arbitrary pulses
* [Hardware timers and how this core uses them for PWM and millis](PWMandTimers.md) is documented in this document. PWM frequencies are designed to be similar to popular classic AVR devices by default.
* [Manufacturer specified "speed grade" that the 0/1-series are rated for](SpeedGrades.md) are documented here, and are extremely conservative.
* ["Tuning" the internal oscillator to different speeds](Tuning.md) is supported since 2.4.0. You can use the inclucded sketch as described here with a trusted timebase to generate calibrated values to write to USERROW, and have the core use those - but if there are no such constants stored, we'll take our best guess.
* [Manual power saving and sleep configuration](PowerSave.md) until I write the long delayed power saving library (avr/power.h doesn't do anything on these parts)

## Special Libraries
The libraries included with the core have README files associated with them
* [tinyNeoPixel - based closely off of adafruitNeopixel library](tinyNeoPixel.md), optimized for minimized space, with support for all clock speeds megatTinyCore supports higher than 6MHz.
* [Logic](../libraries/Logic/README.md) (CCL) - the Logic library provides an easy to use wrapper around the "Configurable Custom Logic" blocks. The API matches DxCore and MegaCoreX versions of the library.
* [Comparator](../libraries/Comparator/README.md) interfaces with the analog comparator or comparators on these devices. The API matches DxCore and MegaCoreX versions of the library.
* [Event](../libraries/Event/README.md) for working with the Event System (EVSYS). The API matches DxCore and MegaCoreX versions of the library, which is to say that it doesn't address many of the key pain points you're likely to encounter when working with the event system.
* [SPI](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore#spi-support) which works just like the normal one.
* [Wire](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore#i2c-twi-support) which works like the standard one, but has a few extra features (and multimaster support coming soon!)
* [USERSIG](../libraries/USERSIG/README.md) for storing data in the User Signature Space (often called the "USERROW" but we can't call the library that because it's already defined by the io headers). Same API as EEPROM library.
* Servo and Servo_megaTinyCore for controlling standard hobby servos. If you've installed the Servo library through library manager, you will need to use Servo_megaTinyCore.h in order to use the (compatible) version included with the core instead of the (incompatible) one installed in libraries folder. Both copies of the library have the same API as normal Servo.h.
* [Optiboot_flasher](../libraries/Optiboot_flasher) for calling into the Optiboot bootloader to write to the flash from application code. Like MegaCoreX's version and similar to some classic Optiboot-supported parts, and totally different from DxCore's Flash.h.
