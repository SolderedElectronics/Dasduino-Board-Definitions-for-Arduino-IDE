### WARNING: On pre 2.0.0 versions of megaTinyCore, the UART defaulted to the alternate positions
This matches the megaTinyCore 412/402 Rev. - and Rev. A breakout boards below. **In 2.0.0 and later, this is no longer the case!** You must call Serial.swap(1) prior to Serial.begin() to move it to the alt pins (or connect your adapter to pins 0 and 1 instead of 2 and 3). It should never have been done that way in the first place. A Rev. B of the breakout boards that has the FTDI header tied to the standard serial pins is planned for availability in May 2020.

### Signature Issue
There exist ATtiny402's in the wild where the last byte of the signature is 0x25, instead of 0x27. Currently shipping parts from Atmel/Microchip have the correct signature, and this problem appears to be in the past, for the most part. Hoerver, if you're stuck with wrong-signature ATtiny402's, choose ATtiny402 (bad signature) from the tools -> chip menu.
