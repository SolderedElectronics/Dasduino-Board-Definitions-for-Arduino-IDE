## Clock Options
These parts do not support an external HF crystal, only an external clock, and/or a watch crystak for the RTC.

When external clock is used as system clock source, it cannot be used for any other purpose (obviously) - all control over that pin is taken by CLKCTRL.

* The overclocked options at 24/25 MHz have been found to generally work around room temperature when running at 5v. For faster speeds, initial results seem to imply that the 2-series parts are significantly more capable of handling higher operating frequencies compared to the 0/1-series, and that with solid 5v supply, 32 MHz at room temperature may be good enough for practical use! Whereas the previous parts collapsed at around 30-32 MHz running from internal oscillator, that isn't seen until the mid 30's on the 2-series parts. As always, external oscillators work more reliably than the internal one when overclocking, but they generally cost about as much as the microcontroller itself and are gross overkill (in terms of accuracy) for what most arduino folks want from them.

The tuned options are new in 2.4.0 - see the [tuned internal oscillator guide](Tuning.md) for more information before using these options.

## Overview
The 24-pin 2-series benefit from fact that the Reset function can be moved to pin PB4, allowing PA0 to remain UPDI, while also having a proper hardware reset! Like the 24-pin 0/1-series, the VQFN-24 package is the only option, no doubt a disappointment to those hoping to assemble them at home.

As with the rest of the 2-series, the DAC, TCD, and the extra analog comparators have been removed in favor of a second UART, and the super ADC, which can accumulate 1024 samples in a single burst read (for 17 bit decimated values, and hence in theory 17-bits of resolution. For advanced ADC functionality, several new functions are provided, see ADC section of the main readme for more information. You do start to miss the TCD's extra PWM pins as you get up to 20+ GPIO pins, while still stuck with just one good PWM timer... Oh well - the point of the 2-series is the dual serial and the killer ADC.

### Great for CCL
We also get a full suite of 4 CCL logic blocks and both the CCL and event system are fully functional here, like the megaAVR 0-series and Dx-series, not the no-interrupt version of the CCL and the confusing and limited event system with two kinds of channels that plague the 0/1-series. The 42x parts, particularly the 427 will have another claim to fame by be lowest cost part with 4 CCL LUTs, the 24-pin ones having all CCL lines on actual pins (not that you usually need them all on physical pins. In fact, it looks likely that all flash sizes of the 2-series will be cheaper than anything else with 4 LUTs.

## Bootloader
Optiboot is included and with the alternate reset option, you can have normal autoreset to enter the bootloader like a "normal" optiboot device without rendering it un-reprogrammable via UPDI (which would preclude setting fuses among other things). That said, many users prefer to use one serial adapter for UPDI programming (either via SerialUPDI or some other programmer) and have a second serial adapter, which is kept open in some serial serial monitor that isn't the Arduino IDE, dispensing with the bootloader altogether. (This is what I do, using hTerm - pretty much the only thing that the Arduino IDE serial monitor has going for it is that it automatically disconnects while uploading; otherwise it lacks nearly every feature that one might want for embedded development).

For these parts, provided they have 8k+ flash, I make no recommendation between Optiboot with alternate reset pin vs use with UPDI programming and no bootloader - it comes down to your preferences and development workflow. For the 4k flash parts, I question the wisdom of dedicating 1/8th of the flash for a bootloader offering little practical benefit.

## Buy official megaTinyCore breakouts and support continued development
To be designed in the future, if people suddenly start showing interest in the 24-pin tinyAVR parts - sales of the 24-pin boards for the 0 and 1-series parts have been very poor compared to the 20-pin ones, even for assembled boards, which I find mystifying. I don't know who's using them all - clearly *someone* is because they're backordered into next year, but whoever it is, they're not using my boards.. As I have in excess of 200 unused tinyAVR x07/x17 breakout boards I'm in no hurry to design a Rev. C to support the alt reset pin and sign up to have another 100 or so produced.

[The existing boards for the 0-series and 1-series 24-pin parts work, but they don't support the alternate rewset pin for autoreset](https://www.tindie.com/products/17613/)

## Notes on Tables
`*`Maximum frequency that the the internal oscillator will reach when tuned upwards until it crashes, and the maximum frequency the part actually runs at (based on cursory, not rigorous testing - the parts that ran for a few milliseconds without crashing or failing to perform correct arithmetic with a few unsigned longs was enough to be considered "working") are reported. Both are at 5.0V and are typical values determined experimentally, and the parts may not function reliably at those speeds under more realistic conditions. Maximums vary between individual specimens. *Don't rely on parts exceeding manufacturer specifications*.

`**` PWM channels exposed with default configuration via analogWrite(). TCA0 is in split mode, and the type B timer(s) are not used for PWM; those could be configured by user code to get two additional channels.
