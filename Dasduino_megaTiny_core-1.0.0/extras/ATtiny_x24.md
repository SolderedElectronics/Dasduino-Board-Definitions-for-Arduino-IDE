## Clock Options
These parts do not support an external HF crystal, only an external clock, and/or a watch crystak for the RTC.

When external clock is used as system clock source, it cannot be used for any other purpose (obviously) - all control over that pin is taken by CLKCTRL.

* The overclocked options at 24/25 MHz have been found to generally work around room temperature when running at 5v. For faster speeds, initial results seem to imply that the 2-series parts are significantly more capable of handling higher operating frequencies compared to the 0/1-series, and that with solid 5v supply, 32 MHz at room temperature may be good enough for practical use! Whereas the previous parts collapsed at around 30-32 MHz running from internal oscillator, that isn't seen until the mid 30's on the 2-series parts. As always, external oscillators work more reliably than the internal one when overclocking, but they generally cost about as much as the microcontroller itself and are gross overkill (in terms of accuracy) for what most arduino folks want from them.

The tuned options are new in 2.4.0 - see the [tuned internal oscillator guide](Tuning.md) for more information before using these options.

## Overview
The smallest pincount of the tinyAVR 2-series parts - so far there is no word on what Microchip's plans are for the 8-pin package, but everyone I've spoken to is worried about the future of AVRs in 8-pin packages.. These have been announced in the full range of flash size options - Hopefully it won't be a repeat of the 3214 which was in the ATpacks, but never actually shipped, and had all references to it removed. Notice that some 1-series features - mostly the extravagances of the "golden" 1-series parts,  but also the type D timer - are gone, while the second type B timer (thankfully) is present in all sizes. The main features though are the fancy ADC, and the second USART - as well as a 32k version with 3k SRAM. The expanded RAM on the 4k and 8k parts goes a long way to making those parts more practical option.

The super ADC can accumulate 1024 samples in a single burst read; decimation of the accumulated value so all of the digits are meaningful can give up to 17-bits of accuracy. For advanced ADC functionality, several new functions are provided, see ADC section of the main readme for more information.

Optiboot is supported, but unlike the higher pincount 2-series devices, you can't have an alternate reset pin here (the pin it can be moved to doesn't exist), so these have the same reset-pain as the 1-series; this is why optiboot is marked 'not recommended' even on parts that have plenty of flash. We default to TCB1 for millis, since there is no type D timer, and because we have TCB0 for tone or TCB-dependant libraries, and TCA0 is more likely to be needed than a second TCB - [taking over TCA0](TakingOverTCA0.md) seems to be quite popular; TCB1 also has the additional benefit of having the lowestr overhead both for the interrupt millis/micros.


## Buy official megaTinyCore breakouts and support continued development
With no critical hardware differences, the same breakout boards we have been selling for the ATtiny1614 and 1614 can be used. We do have a new version in the works with improvements across the whole family, with better silkscreen (including both Pxn notation and key functions, ex. SDA, TX/RX, etc), slightly narrower 0.6" spacing between the rows of pins (for use with sockets and/or prototyping board that caters to that widely used spacing), and support for an external 3.2 x 2.5mm oscillator to supply F_CPU if you really feel you need that.

## Notes on Tables
`*`Maximum frequency that the the internal oscillator will reach when tuned upwards until it crashes, and the maximum frequency the part actually runs at (based on cursory, not rigorous testing - the parts that ran for a few milliseconds without crashing or failing to perform correct arithmetic with a few unsigned longs was enough to be considered "working") are reported. Both are at 5.0V and are typical values determined experimentally, and the parts may not function reliably at those speeds under more realistic conditions. Maximums vary between individual specimens. *Don't rely on parts exceeding manufacturer specifications*.

`**` PWM channels exposed with default configuration via analogWrite(). TCA0 is in split mode, and the type B timer(s) are not used for PWM.
