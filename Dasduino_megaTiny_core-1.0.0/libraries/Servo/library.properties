sentence=Allows post-2016 AVR parts to control a variety of servo motors. If IDE uses version from libraries, include Servo_megaTinyCore.h instead, keeping all other code identical.
paragraph=This library can control a great number of servos.<br />It makes careful use of timers: the library can control 12 servos using only 1 timer, and does not depend on TCA0 prescaler.<br /> 1.2.0 actually works, unlike 1.1.7, and a great deal of changes were made under the hood.<br /> 1.2.1 - Add support for tinyAVR 2-series and AVR Dx-series parts, improve comments and formatting.<br />
