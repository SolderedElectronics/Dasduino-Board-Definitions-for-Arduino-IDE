/* Minimal demo of uaing the ADC to read temperature and operating voltage
 * This has not yet been updated to cover temperature on the new 2-series parts
 *
 * Reading Vdd on the 2-series is VERY easy though, because there's a channel
 * called VDDDIV10, and the core presents it as ADC_VDDDIV10. Care to guess
 * what voltage analogRead(ADC_VDDDIV10) measures?
 *    Maybe... the supply voltage, Vdd, divided by 10?
 * So you can just switch to the internal 1.024V reference (or the others if
 * you prefer less accurate measurements) and read it. The math is even much
 * easier... with the reference voltages as multiples of 1024, the 1.024v
 * reference is in units of 0.25 mV. To get millivolts, just divide by 4.
