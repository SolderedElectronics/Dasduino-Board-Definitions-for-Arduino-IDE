# Event
A library for interfacing with the built-in Event system on the megaAVR-0 series MCUs.
Developed by [MCUdude](https://github.com/MCUdude/).

**From the datasheet:**
> The Event System (EVSYS) enables direct peripheral-to-peripheral signaling. It allows a change in one peripheral (the event generator) to trigger actions in other peripherals (the event users) through event channels, without using the CPU. It is designed to provide short and predictable response times between peripherals, allowing for autonomous peripheral control and interaction, and also for synchronized timing of actions in several peripheral modules. It is thus a powerful tool for reducing the complexity, size, and execution time of the software.

More information about the Event system and how it works can be found in the [Microchip Application Note AN2451](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/DS00002451B.pdf) and in the [megaAVR-0 family data sheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/megaAVR0-series-Family-Data-Sheet-DS40002015B.pdf).

## Library usability issues
We are aware that the library currently lacks any facility to convert between generator and user constants that this library uses and either Arduino pin numbers, or port letters and bit positions. This deficiency compromises the usefulness of this library, and prevents writing portable code, which is the reason for the existence of this library in the first place. The interface presented below may undergo moderate to drastic changes in order to provide a more useful abstraction. See [issue #480](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore/issues/480)

## Level vs. Pulse events
There are two types of events - a "pulse" interrupt, which lasts for the duration of a single clock cycle (either `CLK_PER` or a relevant (slower) clock - for example, the USART XCK generator provides a pulse event which lasts one XCK period, which is far slower than CLK_PER (the "peripheral; . while the TCD0-derived ones are ) or a "level" interrupt which lasts for the duration of some condition. Often for a given even generator or user only one or the other makes sense. Less often, for some reason or another, you may need a level event, but all you have is a pulse event - or the other way around. A [CCL module (Logic.h)](../Logic/README.md) event between the two at the cost of the logic module and one event channel. In the case of timer WO (PWM) channels, the CCL already has level inputs to match the pulse inputs that the event system can get on compare match. Many of the pulse interrupts are generated at the same moment that interrupt flags get set - except that where an interrupt bit sticks around until serviced, the pulse bit is present generally for only a single clock cycle (meaning they are only *usable* for triggering other event system things or peripherals. s can be (they often let you do similar things faster with less CPU involvement, too), but unlike interrupts, they won't stick around until you explicitly clear them


## Synchronization
The 0/1-series are weird here - read the 2-series section first.

### 2-series
The event system, under the hood, is asynchronous - it can react faster than the system clock (often a lot faster). On the 2-series, these work like the Dx-series and presumably future releases will. Per the datasheet for the 2-series:

>Events can be either synchronous or asynchronous to the peripheral clock. Each Event System channel has two subchannels: one asynchronous and one synchronous.
>The asynchronous subchannel is identical to the event output from the generator. If the event generator generates a signal asynchronous to the peripheral clock, the signal on the asynchronous subchannel will be asynchronous. If the event generator generates a signal synchronous to the peripheral clock, the signal on the asynchronous subchannel
>will also be synchronous.
>The synchronous subchannel is identical to the event output from the generator, if the event generator generates a signal synchronous to the peripheral clock. If the event generator generates a signal asynchronous to the peripheral clock, this signal is first synchronized before being routed onto the synchronous subchannel. Depending on when the event occurs, synchronization will delay the it by two to three clock cycles. The Event System automatically perform this synchronization if an asynchronous generator is selected for an event channel.

The fact that it is asynchronous usually doesn't matter - it's either "faster than anything else" (if the user is async), or "2-3 clock cycles behind", but it is one of the things one should keep in mind when using these features, because every so often it does.

### 0/1-series
Unlike the 2-series, where sync vs async is handled transparently, there are no hidden subchannels here. There are two channels with synchronizers and 4 without. Two of the peripherals care: USART0 and TCA0 can only use the sync channels. Everything else can use either kind. The layout of channels is also totally different.

## Generator table
Below is a table with all possible generators for each channel. The event system on the 0/1-series and on the 2-series is very different in this regard
The generators associated with pins are only available on parts that have that pin, and those associated with a peripheral. Similarly are only defined where that peripheral exists. .

### 0-series and 1-series
Yes, this is a terribly messy setup compared to the 2-series (and every other product line with an event system - this was the first, and they realized their mistake - albeit too late for these). There are two kinds of generators, synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous users (TCA0, USART0) can only use synchronous generators, while async. users can use any generator. The synchronization or lack thereof is w/regards to `CLK_PER`Note that in cases where the same generator is listed for multiple channels, but prefixed with gen followed by a number, they are NOT interchangible. `gen4::ac1_out` is not the same as `gen2::ac2_out`... the values are all over the place.

Only the 1-series parts have Event1 (Sync channel 1), Event4, and Event5;

Many parts with lower pincount do not have any options specific to a channel available. Level events are marked with an `L` on this chart; all others are pulses, with the clock domain named if it isn't CLK_PER (CPU clock speed)

Notes:
There are no ADC event channels on 0/1-series. Nope, I dunno why either. It's unfortunate that on the only AVRs with 2 ADCs, we don't get to use them for events!
There are no SPI or USART events here, either.
The TCD events are async and **based on the TCD clock** which may be faster than the peripheral clock. If for example, you are feeding it to a CCL with the synchronizer enabled, events can be missed.
RTC evens are async pulse events, but they are based on the RTC clock domain, which is typically hundreds of times slower than the main clock.
While the analog comparator generators are available on every async channel, they are not interchangible; they have different numerical values on each one!
There is a general appearance of the system being designed without fully thinking things through, resulting in all this weirdness. This is supported by the fact that the megaAVR 0-series and all other chips released since have been the same as each other, and different from the 0/1-series: They realized these things were dumb and weird, and changed them.

#### 2-series
On the 2-series parts, they put a synchronizer onto each channel, making it into two subchannels, a sync and async one, which is completely transparent to the user. The channels are far more flexible; like all other parts with an event system except the 0/1-series, only the port pins, and which set of taps off the PIT it gets are different between event channels. And they are delivered in pairs as they should be. Unlike, for example, the Dx-series, the event channels wrap around (the Dx-series has a number of channels that have no pin generators!)

Notes:
USART and SPI generators are pulses the length of a the clock on that peripheral.
RTC generators are pulses the length of one RTC clock cycle.

### Notes
* The `evoutN_pin_pN7` is the same as `evoutN_pin_pN2` but where the pin is swapped from 2 to 7. This means that for instance, `evouta_pin_pa2` can't be used in combination with `evouta_pin_pa7`.
* Many of these refer to specific pins or peripherals - on smaller pin-count devices, some of these event users are not available; Attempting to set a user that doesn't exist will result in a compile error.
* This library papers over the fact that the 0/1-series numbered event channels to a peripheral 0 and 1, and everything else uses a and b. a and b are used here exclusively to refer to what the 0/1-series datasheets call 0 and 1.



## The Event class
Class for interfacing with the Event systemn (`EVSYS`). Each event channel has its own object.
Use the predefined objects `Event0`, `Event1`, `Event2`, `Event3`, `Event4`, `Event5`. These, alternately, are known as `EventSync0`, `EventSync1`, `EventAsync0`, `EventAsync1`, `EventAsync2`, `EventAsync3` on the tinyAVR 0-series and 1-series. Note that not all generators are available on all channels, so make sure you use the right channel for the task; see the tables above.

### get_channel_number()
Method to get the current channel number. Useful if the channel object has been passed to a function as reference.

#### Usage
``` c++
uint8_t what_channel(Event& event_chan) {
  event_chan.get_channel_number();
}
```

### get_user_channel()
Method to get what event channel a user is connected to. Returns -1 if not connected to any channel. Note that we use `user::` as prefix when we refer to event users. This is a static method - you don't have to specify an object to determine what channel the user is connected to. An event channel, and hence an event generator, can have as many event users are you want - but an event user can only have one event generator. You cannot get a list or count of all users connected to a generator except by iterating over the list.

#### Usage
```c++
uint8_t connected_to = Event::get_user_channel(user::ccl0_event_a); // Returns the channel number ccl0_event_a is connected to
```

### set_generator()
Method to assign an event generator to a channel. Note that we use the prefix genN:: (where N is the channel number) when referring to generators unique to this particular channel. we use gen:: when referring to generators available on all generators.

#### Usage
```c++
Event0.set_generator(gen::ccl0_out); // Use the output of logic block 0 (CCL0) as an event generator for Event0
Event2.set_generator(gen2::pin_pc0); // Use pin PC0 as an event generator for Event2
```

### get_generator()
Method to get the generator used for a particular channel.

#### Usage
```c++
uint8_t generator_used = Event0.get_generator();
if(generator_used == gen::ccl0_out) {
  Serial.println("We're using gen::ccl0_out as generator");
}
```


### set_user()
Method to connect an event user to an event generator. Note that a generator can have multiple users.

#### Usage
```c++
Event0.set_generator(gen0::pin_pa0); // Set pin PA0` as event generator for Event0
Event0.set_user(user::evoutc);       // Set EVOUTC (pin PC2) as event user
Event0.set_user(user::ccl0_event_a); // Also set CCL0 Event 0/Event A in event user (See Logic library)
```



### clear_user()
Method to detach a user from a channel. This is a static method - you don't need to know what channel to detach from, simply use `Event::clear_user()`.

#### Usage
```c++
Event::clear_user(user::evouta); // Remove the user::evouta from whatever event channel it is connected to.
```

### soft_event()
Creates a single software event - users connected to that channel will react to it in the same way as they would to one caused by the generator the channel is connected to. This can be used either to force something which could occur naturally (ex: for testing) - or the your use case may be predicated on pulses being entirely software generated in this way. Note that a software event only lasts a single system clock cycle - so it will not pass through a CCL's filter (for example) which could be useful, but is more likely to be undesirable. The software events will invert the channel, and so will trigger something regardless of whether it needs a the event channel to go high or low. Using a Type B timer in 1-shot mode.

*It is planned that a future update will implement a long_soft_event() to get a short software event that is long enough to pass through the CCL's filters, or (with a jumper to SCK) clock our own slave SPI; but the best that is possible is a terrible kludge: a block of inline assembly that sets the X, Y, or Z register to point to the appropriate strobe register and then disables interrupts while sending multiple, consecutive and identical ST instructions. long_soft_event will be a fixed number of system clocks (or one of a small number of options, depending on what I can get the compiler to implement sanely and efficiently), since each write to the strobe register asserts the event for only 1 system clock cycle, while the fastest loop possible in the AVR instruction set is 3 clock cycles long.*

#### Usage
```c++
Event0.soft_event(); // Create a single software event on Event0
```

### start()
Starts an event generator channel by writing the generator selected by `set_generator()` method to the `EVSYS.CHANNELn` register.

#### Usage
```c++
Event0.start(); // Starts the Event0 generator channel
```

### stop()
Stops an event generator channel by clearing the `EVSYS.CHANNELn` register. The `EventN` object retains memory of what generator it was previously set to.

#### Usage
```c++
Event0.stop(); // Stops the Event0 generator channel
```
