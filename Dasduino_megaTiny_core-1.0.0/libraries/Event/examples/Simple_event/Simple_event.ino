| A library for interfacing with the megaAVR event system.              |
| Developed in 2021 by MCUdude and adapted to tinyAVR by Spence Konde   |

|                                                                       |
| In this example we use pin PA1 as an event generator, and pin PA2 and |
| as event users. In practive, pin PA2 will follow PA1's state          |
| This trivial example is works without modification on both the 0/1-   |
| series and the 2=series. with no #ifdefs. That is rare.               |
|                                                                       |
| See Microchip's application note AN2451 for more information.         |
