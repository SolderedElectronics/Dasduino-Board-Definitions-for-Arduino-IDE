| A library for interfacing with the megaAVR event system.              |
| Developed in 2021 by MCUdude and adapted to tinyAVR by Spence Konde   |
| https://github.com/MCUdude/                                           |
|                                                                       |
| In this example, we demonstrate the possibilities of reading out what |
| event channel we're working with, what generator is used, and which   |
| channel an event user has been connected to.                          |
| Notice the #if to use different code depending on what kind of part it|
| is - we wanted to use 2 channels, and channel 2 is one of the few     |
| channels that have some of the same pins on them.                     |
|                                                                       |
| See Microchip's application note AN2451 for more information.         |
