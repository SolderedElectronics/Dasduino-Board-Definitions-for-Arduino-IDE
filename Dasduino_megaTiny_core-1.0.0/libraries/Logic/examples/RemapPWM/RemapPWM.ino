| A library for interfacing with the megaAVR Configurable Custom Logic. |
| Developed in 2019 by MCUdude.       Example by Spence Konde 2020-2021 |
| https://github.com/MCUdude/            https://github.com/SpenceKonde |
|                                                                       |
| In this example we use the configurable logic peripheral to direct a  |
| PWM Waveform Output (WO) to an arbitrary, different pin.              |
|
| Consider an ATtiny 0, 1, or 2 series, and maximizing the number of    |
| 8-bit PWM channels. On the 14-pin parts, we can get at most 6 from    |
| TCA0, and that's it - the other timer PWM pins are the same as those! |
| TCB0, and (on parts that have it) TCB1 are both sghared with TCA0 pins|
| and so are TCD0 WOA and WOB pins. If we are desperate for another PWM |
| channel (such that we would resort to using a TCB for PW< - they're   |
| lousy for PWM generation - or figure out how to work with TCD0 which  |
| is pretty ugly (actually, since you don't need to enable pin output   |
| TCD is significantly easier to handle here, but still beyond the scope|
| of the example) - you can use the CCL to reroute a PWM signal that    |
| wouldn't have a pin to call it's own onto the logic output pin        |
