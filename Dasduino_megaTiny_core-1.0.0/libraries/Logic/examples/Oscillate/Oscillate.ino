  | A library for interfacing with the megaAVR Configurable Custom Logic. |
  | Developed in 2019 by MCUdude.                                         |
  | https://github.com/MCUdude/                                           |
  |                                                                       |
  | In this example, we demonstrate the fact that these are ASYCHRONOUS   |
  | by (ab)using the CCL in a configuration which will oscillate - this   |
  | example uses two logic blocks - though there are plenty of ways to    |
  | make it oscillate with a single one (see if you can come up with some |
  | - assuming you find this fun). If you set values for the filter, you  |
  | get sane output frequencies - just what one would expect from the     |
  | datasheet. But what fun is that?! If you turn them both off, it       |
  | oscillates much faster - faster than the clock speed! with a sawtooth |
  | waveform which (measured by my 'scope) clocks in at 37 MHz - from a   |
  | part running at 20 MHz! Sadly, the amplitude I measure is only 1.8~2.8|
  | volts (the poor output drivers - or my scope - can't keep up)... at   |
  | room temperature! Point a can of freeze spray (computer duster held   |
  | upside-down, so the liquid comes out) and the frequency goes up.      |
  | Aim a heat-gun or torch at it (use care - freeze spray DOES burn, and |
  | you do NOT want to inhale the combustion products. So do PCBs if you  |
  | aren't careful with that torch) and the frequency goes down. This is  |
  | of essentially zero practical use, but it sure is cool isn't it?      |
  |                                                                       |
