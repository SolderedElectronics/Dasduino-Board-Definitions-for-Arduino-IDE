  |                                                                       |
  | A library for interfacing with the megaAVR Configurable Custom Logic. |
  | Developed in 2019 by MCUdude.                                         |
  | https://github.com/MCUdude/                                           |
  |                                                                       |
  | In this example we use the configurable logic peripherals of the      |
  | tinyAVR to achieve the "modulate one timer's wave output with another"|
  | behavior like some of the more full-featured classic megaAVR parts    |
  | We set one input to TCA0 WO1, the other to TCB0 WO, and mask the third|
  | and set the truth table so that the output is only HIGH when both are |
  | As can be immediately seen, this is vastly more powerful than what the|
  | classic AVRs were capable of, where this could be done only with two  |
  | timers on a single pin.                                               |
  | We could even use the CCL as an event generator to move the output to |
  | one of the EVOUT pins!                                                |
