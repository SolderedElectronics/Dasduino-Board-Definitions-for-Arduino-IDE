| A library for interfacing with the megaAVR Configurable Custom Logic. |
| Developed in 2019 by MCUdude.       Example by Spence Konde 2020-2021 |
| https://github.com/MCUdude/            https://github.com/SpenceKonde |
|                                                                       |
| In this example we use the configurable logic peripherals of the      |
| tinyAVR to achieve the "modulate one timer's wave output with another"|
| behavior like some of the more full-featured classic megaAVR parts    |
| We set one input to TCA0 WO1, the other to TCB0 WO, and mask the third|
| and set the truth table so that the output is only HIGH when both are |
| As can be immediately seen, this is vastly more powerful than what the|
| classic AVRs were capable of, where this could be done only with two  |
| timers on a single pin.                                               |
| We could even use the CCL as an event generator to move the output to |
| one of the EVOUT pins!                                                |
