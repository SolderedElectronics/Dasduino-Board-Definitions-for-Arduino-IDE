   0011    E Roy       13/02/18 ported to ATmega4809
  1.3.3    S Konde      3/30/21 Fixed bug where output could be left high.
                       Fixed bug that would cause anomalies on PORTB through use of
                       a NULL pointer, which points rght at the low IO space. Just return
                       if the pin isn't a valid pin.
                       Fix anomalous silent pointless interrupts for duration of a
                       frequency=0 "tone" Now I just drive pin low and turn off timer.
                        You asked for 0 Hz? That's 0 Hz alright!
                       In all cases, we ave to avoid leaving it high because
                       that can damage speakers, so I am told..
                       Just return and turn off tone if it's the current tone pin
                       bit_mask was declared volatile; but it shouldn't.
                       _pin was not decared volatile when it should be.
                       Fix bug where high-pitch tones old overflow when calculating
                       duration (the intermediate 2 * frequency was an unsigned int,
                       even though next operation multipolied it by an unsigned long
                       - simply reoved the 2* altogether and divide by 500 at end instead
                       of 1000.
                       Long tones (where frequency * duration > 2.145 billion resulted in an
                       intermediate overflowing before the divide by 1000. removing the 2* doubled this limit.
                       But high frequencies and long durations (where frequency * duration would overflow
                       a unsigned long) still break it. I added a way to distribute the division before
                       the multiplication if the duration was long enough to start worrying about. But I
                       decided not to enable by default, it is SUPPORT_LONG_TONES - if defined and 1,
                       when duration is over 2^16, we split that line into (frequency/5) * (duration/100)
                       This version was developed for DxCore 1.3.3 and megaTinyCore 2.3.0
1.3.6                   4/17/21 Fixed bug that would break compilation of all sketches if
                       TCB0 was used for millis on partss without a TCB1. Now, we intentionally break
                       the compilation only if the user code actually calls tone() or noTone()
                       This version was developed for DxCore 1.3.6 and megaTinyCore 2.3.2
