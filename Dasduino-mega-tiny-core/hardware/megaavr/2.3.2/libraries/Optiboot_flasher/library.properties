sentence=Read and write contents to the flash memory
paragraph=An alternative to the limited EEPROM in these devices. Requires Optiboot bootloader on the board, since only code executing from the bootloader section can write to the application section (it is not possible to make an "application data" section (which is writable from application code) if a bootloader section is not also defined). There are two approaches to working within this in order to write to flash from the application when not uploading through a bootloader. These are not supported by this library. Do not confuse this library with the DxCore Flash library: There is also a Flash.h supplied with DxCore; like this library, it allows writing to the flash from the application through an object named Flash by calling into the bootloader section. Everything else about the two libraries (API, fundamental design goals, method of calling the bootloader) is completely different, as the two were written independently by different authors working under different constraints for different versions of NVMCTRL.
